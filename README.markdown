**This is my humble attempt at a kanban for software**

I have read numerous books on lean manufacturing, but only a few articles on lean software development.
So this is my take on applying *one* of the principles of lean thinking, sorta 'tabula rasa', which is to make work visible.

It's also a chance for me to learn more about a concepts I am interested in, BDD and MVC architecture.

This is currently very much under development :)
